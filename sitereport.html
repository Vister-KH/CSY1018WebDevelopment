        <h2>Experience of learning the web development basics.</h2>
        <p> This was my first time using Visual Studio Code and working on anything this scale. I have previously not done any coding before and at first this was very overwhelming. There was a lot to learn and often at times I would look at the code and not know why it worked or it didn't. However thanks to Tom and all the helpful tutorials provided I started going through them. Starting right from the basics I started writing code down, which also I haven't done before and then slowly putting things together. Once I was able to figure code out and spot patterns I would then apply that code and pattern to other sites.</p>
        <p> Each week as more tutorials and videos were realeased I would look into those and try and apply the new code to the existing one and build up on it. This would improve the visual aspect of the website since there was more features appearing on the site.
        <p> Due to the current world wide pandemic, I found that being unable to see the teachers or any students face to face had a dramatic impact on the overall course. This is mainly because of my work ethic. I'm a very social person and meeting and discussing topics is the best way for me to learn. I'm really hoping that next year we will be able to meet up again which hopefully will have a possitive impact on the course and learning code will be easier.</p>
        <h2>The technical and design of sites user interface.</h2>
        <h2>The design</h3>
        <p> The design aspects of the website which I have concentrated on were the colour scheme, the layout of the webiste and the userbility of the website. Initially when designing the site the 3 colours which I picked where; grey for the background, black for the text with white colour when highlighted and a violet background. However after speaking to a friend who I asked to give me their opinion on the website I quickly came to the conclusion that the violet colour was a poor choice since it was really bright and if the user were to stare at it for a long period of time it would be painfull. The new terquoise colour was implemented instead. The font itself is a generic font I have not changed it, this is something I would like to improve on in the future because even though the generic font is clear and easy to read, it is quite boring and repetitive. The layout of the webiste has the main panel in the middle which covers around 70% of the screen with the side panel on the right. There is a footer on the bottom of the site however it only has it's name in it. As an improvement for the site, more information could of been implemented there such as a date and time.     </p>
        <h2>The technical aspects</h3>
        <p> The site has a navigation panel on the top of the site which nagivates the user between the sites. When hoovered over the text changes colour, by clicking the text user is navigated. The style of the site is kept through out the sites. The home button appears on all sites other then the home site so the user can always navigate back to the original site. There is a burger menu on the right hand side which will be display once the web browser is minimised to around 40%. Inside the burger menu there are the 5 main sites which can be accessed. This feature is especially important for mobile access in order to navigates to other sites. There can be improvement made to the burger menu. When hoovering over the top part of the icon the user can click it and the menu will pop up. However if the user tries to click the middle of it or the bottom, the menu doesn't open. Once the menu does come up it can be closed by the X icon. Same issue is happening here, only the top part of the icon is responding. This could also be improved on.       </p>
